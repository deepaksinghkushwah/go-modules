First setup your database server, I have used mysql. You can choose any other and setup config in .env file. When you first run this code, it will create role and user table and populate it with default values.

User Roles
-----------
Admin
Registered

Users
-------
Admin user: admin
Password: 123456

Now if you register new user, it will be registered with "Registered" user role.
